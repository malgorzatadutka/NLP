# Natural Language Processing 
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focuses on text classification using machine learning (ML) algorithms and text summarization through a rule-based approach. Package used in the project `nltk`.
## Basic tasks
1. Classify text using ML algorithms
   - collecting articles from the blog using `BeautifulSoup`,
   - feature extraction via Term Frequency or IF-IDF,
   - `K-Means` algorithm for splitting articles into groups,
   - `K-Nearest Neighbors` algorithm for assigning a theme to the article.
2. Summarize text using rule-based approach
   - collecting articles from the blog using `BeautifulSoup`,
   - split text into sentences,
   - split senteces into words,
   - remove stopwords,
   - find the most common words,
   - count the importance of the particular sentence based on the word frequency,
   - show top most important sentences.
